# Viperidae

Viperidae [vī′per·ə‚dē] is a small scale text and web search engine, designed for accurately searching serveral
web pages (it doesn't, but it's the thought that counts). Created for my Year 12 Major Project with HTML/CSS and Python.

## Localhost user guide

I AM NOT going to pay for a server to host this on so if you want to use it for some reason here's what to do:

### For Windows

1. Install Python 3.x

2. Download or clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/apt-helion/Viperidae`

3. Create a virutal environment in the repo:

`python3 -m venv <enter name>`

4. Install requirements:

`<enter name>\bin\pip install requirements.txt`

5. Run the thing:

`<enter name>\bin\python run.py`

### For OSX

1. I don't know

### For a good operating system

1. Install Gentoo

2. Do the same as Windows except less dumb
